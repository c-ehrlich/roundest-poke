# Roundest Pokémon

## What is this?
An app to vote on which Pokémon is the roundest, and see results. The purpose of this was to become more familiar with tRPC and Tailwind.

Based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKy2lYEnhgs).

## TODO
- [ ] Use next/image to handle image caching and better rendering
  - [ ] Maybe move images to bulbapedia
- [ ] Persist data from PokemonAPI
- [ ] Create the results page with counting/sorting

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

Start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
